## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS for styling and parallax effect
- JavaScript for smooth scrolling interaction

### What I Learned

- Implemented a parallax scrolling effect using CSS background properties and JavaScript.
- Used CSS to overlay colors on the parallax background for a layered look.
- Improved my skills in responsive design and optimizing images for different screen sizes.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Explore more advanced parallax techniques and libraries.
- Enhance accessibility and performance.
- Experiment with interactive elements and animations.
